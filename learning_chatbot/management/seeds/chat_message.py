        "content": """Python offers two primary types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. They serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

---

## 1. `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, range, or other iterable objects). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

**When to use:** When you know the number of iterations beforehand, or when you want to process each item in a collection.

### Basic Syntax

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code to execute for each item
```

### Examples of `for` Loops

```python
print("--- For Loop Examples ---")

# 1. Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("\n1. Iterating over a list:")
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# 2. Iterating a specific number of times (using range())
# range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
print("\n2. Iterating a specific number of times (range(5)):")
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")

# range(start, end)
print("\n   Using range(2, 7):") # Numbers from 2 to 6
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(f"Number: {i}")

# range(start, end, step)
print("\n   Using range(0, 10, 2):") # Numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(f"Even number: {i}")

# 3. Iterating over a string
name = "Python"
print("\n3. Iterating over a string:")
for char in name:
    print(char)

# 4. Iterating with index and value (using enumerate())
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print("\n4. Iterating with index and value (enumerate):")
for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(f"Index {index}: {color}")

# 5. Iterating over a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print("\n5. Iterating over a dictionary:")

# By default, iterates over keys
print("   - Keys:")
for key in person:
    print(key)

# Iterating over values
print("   - Values:")
for value in person.values():
    print(value)

# Iterating over key-value pairs (items)
print("   - Key-Value pairs:")
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# 6. `for` loop with `break` (to exit the loop early)
print("\n6. For loop with 'break':")
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        print("Breaking the loop at 5")
        break  # Exits the loop
    print(i)

# 7. `for` loop with `continue` (to skip the current iteration)
print("\n7. For loop with 'continue':")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        print("Skipping 2")
        continue  # Skips the rest of the current iteration
    print(i)

# 8. `for` loop with `else` block
# The 'else' block executes only if the loop completes without encountering a `break`.
print("\n8. For loop with 'else' block:")
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Looping {i}")
else:
    print("Loop finished normally (no break).")

print("\n   For loop with 'else' (and break):")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        print("Breaking the loop")
        break
    print(f"Looping {i}")
else:
    print("This 'else' block will NOT execute because of break.")

```

---

## 2. `while` Loop

A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

**When to use:** When you don't know the number of iterations beforehand, and you want to keep repeating an action until a certain condition is met (e.g., getting valid user input, processing items from a queue until it's empty).

### Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # code to execute as long as condition is true
```

**Crucial Note:** You must ensure that the condition eventually becomes `False` inside the loop, otherwise, you'll end up with an **infinite loop**!

### Examples of `while` Loops

```python
print("\n\n--- While Loop Examples ---")

# 1. Basic while loop (counter)
count = 0
print("\n1. Basic while loop (counter):")
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1 # Important: increment count to eventually make condition false

# 2. While loop with user input validation
print("\n2. While loop with user input validation:")
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "quit":
    user_input = input("Enter something (type 'quit' to exit): ")
    if user_input.lower() != "quit":
        print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
print("Exited the input loop.")

# 3. `while` loop with `break`
print("\n3. While loop with 'break':")
i = 0
while True: # This creates an infinite loop IF no break is present
    print(f"Inside loop, i is {i}")
    if i == 3:
        print("Breaking out of the loop.")
        break # Exit the loop
    i += 1

# 4. `while` loop with `continue`
print("\n4. While loop with 'continue':")
num = 0
while num < 5:
    num += 1
    if num == 3:
        print(f"Skipping number {num}")
        continue # Skip the rest of the current iteration
    print(f"Current number: {num}")

# 5. `while` loop with `else` block
# The 'else' block executes only if the loop completes without encountering a `break`.
print("\n5. While loop with 'else' block:")
j = 0
while j < 3:
    print(f"Looping {j}")
    j += 1
else:
    print("While loop finished normally (j is no longer < 3).")

print("\n   While loop with 'else' (and break):")
k = 0
while k < 5:
    if k == 2:
        print("Breaking the loop")
        break
    print(f"Looping {k}")
    k += 1
else:
    print("This 'else' block will NOT execute because of break.")

```

---

## When to choose which loop:

*   **`for` loop:** Use when you need to iterate over a finite sequence of items or when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code (e.g., iterating through a list of names, performing an action 10 times).
*   **`while` loop:** Use when you need to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true, and you don't necessarily know in advance how many times it will run (e.g., getting valid user input until it meets criteria, processing data from a stream until it's empty).""",

        "content": """This is a **compact mechanical keyboard** with a distinct custom aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of its features:

1.  **Form Factor:** It's a highly compact layout, most likely a **60% keyboard**, indicated by the absence of a dedicated function row (F1-F12), navigation cluster (like arrow keys, home/end, page up/down), and a numeric keypad. This design prioritizes desk space and a minimalist look, with some functions typically accessed via a "Fn" layer.

2.  **Color Scheme:** The keyboard features a striking multi-color design:
    *   **Case:** A vibrant **deep magenta or fuchsia pink**.
    *   **Main Keycaps (Alphas & Numbers):** **Off-white or cream**, providing a clean, bright contrast.
    *   **Modifier Keycaps:** **Dark charcoal gray or black** (e.g., Shift, Control, Alt, Tab, Caps Lock, Backspace, Super, Fn), creating a sharp division from the main keys.
    *   **Accent Keycaps:** **Light peach or blush pink** for the "Esc" and "Enter" keys, tying in subtly with the case color.

3.  **Keycap Details:**
    *   The legends (characters on the keys) are dark and clearly printed.
    *   The keycaps appear to have a sculpted profile, where rows have different angles and heights for ergonomic typing.

4.  **Overall Impression:** The keyboard looks like a high-quality, possibly custom-built or enthusiast-grade mechanical keyboard, designed for both aesthetic appeal and a satisfying typing experience. It's presented against a plain black background, emphasizing its design.""",
